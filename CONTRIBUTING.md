## Beginner questions
### "What license is this source code provided under?"
Glimpse Image Editor is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3. You can read more details in `COPYING` and `LICENSE`.

### "Which free software project did you fork from?"
The GNU Image Manipulation Program. We believe the "Gimp" name, over-use of a cartoon dog throughout the user interface and an overly-complicated user experience are discouraging individuals and organizations from adopting that software. We want to resolve those problems.

### "Did you really need to fork the project?"
Unfortunately, yes. People had been asking for these changes for over a decade before we began, so now a group of enthusiasts from outside that project are doing their best to implement those ideas.

### "Can you not just use find and replace to change the name?"
No. Refactoring the code and changing variable names breaks the build scripts, sub-components and plug-ins that Glimpse Image Editor relies on. There are also situations where it makes more sense to preserve the original application name (eg. save file compatibility statements, descriptions for plug-ins/procedures, etc).

### "Why do you need monetary donations?"
We ask for monetary donations to reimburse costs such as server hosting, web domains, code signing certificates and professional artwork (among other things). A portion of the donations we receive are also passed back to the GNU Image Manipulation Program each time we produce a new release so that we continue to support the development of components our project relies on.

The Glimpse project is strictly not-for-profit, and you can scrutinize all of our finances here: https://opencollective.com/glimpse/

### "Do you want to become more popular than the GIMP?"
Our primary objective is to expand the use of free software and help new people join the free software community. Replacing the GNU Image Manipulation Program is not our goal, and we believe that supporting and collaborating with the project we forked from is a more productive route forward.

### "Are you planning a complete rewrite?"
Possibly. There has been some early talk about replacing the user interface and plug-in framework, while still using the same underlying components like [GEGL](http://www.gegl.org/). However that is not likely to happen for a number of years (if it ever happens at all), so we primarily focus on improving GNU Image Manipulation Program 2.10.
