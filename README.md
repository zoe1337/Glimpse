# Glimpse

Glimpse is a downstream fork of the GNU Image Manipulation Program. You can find out more information on our FAQs page: https://glimpse-editor.org/about/

## What is different about Glimpse?
For now, not a lot! The initial aim is to provide a downstream fork of the GNU Image Manipulation Program that has a less problematic name so there are no potential barriers to using the software in businesses and educational institutions.

This is a long-standing problem that has drawn user concern for over a decade, but whenever the issue is raised it tends to be dismissed. We do not believe the upstream project's [explanation or workaround](https://www.gimp.org/docs/userfaq.html#i-dont-like-the-name-gimp-will-you-change-it) is enough to address the problem.

In future versions we intend to address other long-standing complaints, particularly around the graphical user interface.

## How will the package versions work?
Glimpse 0.1.0 will be a simple re-branding of the GNU Image Manipulation Program based on version 2.10.12, with some minor fixes to the UI and build system. You can see how this effort is going in the [dev-g210](https://github.com/glimpse-editor/Glimpse/tree/dev-g210) branch.

We will stick to following upstream releases until we "hard fork" at v3.0. After the hard fork we can be more ambitious with our changes.

## How can I keep up to date with Glimpse's progress?
Our official project website is now live (but still under construction) at https://glimpse-editor.org.
