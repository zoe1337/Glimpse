# Glimpse Image Editor
Glimpse Image Editor is a downstream fork (derivative work) based on the GNU Image Manipulation Program 2.10.18 source code, and it is shared under the terms of the GNU General Public License version 3.

You can find out more information on our FAQs page: https://glimpse-editor.github.io/about/

## What is different about the Glimpse fork?
The GNU Image Manipulation Program is primarily intended for long-standing Linux enthusiasts and power users.

Glimpse Image Editor is an optional alternative intended to assist users that are offended or made uncomfortable by the "gimp" name, and assist free software advocates that encounter barriers when they recommend the GNU Image Manipulation Program to friends, family, coworkers and employers.

Our project also focusses on making the software more "enterprise ready" so it is easier to modify and distribute for schools and workplaces. That means fewer "easter eggs", improved build and packaging tooling/documentation, backported fixes on a known-stable base we support for at least a year, and a more efficient Windows installer. 

We also plan to have a more predictable release cadence. That will assist IT departments with their software deployment schedules, and ensure they can deploy security fixes without affecting their existing tooling. Teachers can also create lesson plans around the software and have confidence that there will be no major UI or functional changes in the same academic year.

## How will the package versions work?
* Glimpse Image Editor 0.1.0 and 0.1.2 fork from GNU Image Manipulation Program 2.10.12
* Glimpse Image Editor 0.2.0 forks from GNU Image Manipulation Program 2.10.18

You can read more information about this and our ongoing release schedule at https://glimpse-editor.github.io/about/#how-does-your-release-numbering-work

We also have a working group designing a completely new image editing program called "Glimpse NX", but it will be a number of years before that effort comes to fruition.
